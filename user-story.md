# User Story: Library Management System

## Description

As a library administrator, I want to implement a modern library management system using Rails + Vite + Tailwind CSS, so that I can efficiently manage books, users, and loans while providing a great user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Librarians can add, edit, and manage books with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Members can search, browse, and borrow books
- [ ] System tracks loan history and manages overdue books
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] API endpoints available for external integrations
- [ ] Modern UI built with React components and Tailwind CSS

## Technical Notes

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 7.1 with PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0 with Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **Authentication**: Devise gem for user management
- **Authorization**: Pundit gem for role-based access control
- **Testing**: RSpec with FactoryBot for comprehensive test coverage
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent environments
- **API**: RESTful API with both public and authenticated endpoints

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Set up Rails application with Vite and Tailwind CSS integration
2. [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database and run initial migrations
3. [ ] Implement Devise authentication with user roles
4. [ ] Create Book model with validations and relationships
5. [ ] Build Loan model to track borrowing history
6. [ ] Develop React components for book management interface
7. [ ] Implement search and filtering functionality
8. [ ] Create user dashboards for different roles
9. [ ] Build API endpoints for external integrations
10. [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage with RSpec
11. [ ] Configure Docker for development and deployment
12. [ ] Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Additional Information

- **Project Structure**: Follow Rails conventions with React components in `app/frontend/`
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for advanced features like full-text search
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for rapid UI development
- **Build Tool**: Vite offers fast HMR and optimized production builds
- **Authentication**: Devise handles user registration, login, and password management
- **Authorization**: Pundit policies control access to different features based on user roles
